# Image web with memory game

This simple image web is used to show some images related to biostatsics knowledge, these images can be searched by key words. However, users cannot see this iamge directly. They need to pass a small memory game to see the images. The game has a 4 &times; 4 table, 8 pairs number. Users have 10 seconds to remember the position of number pairs, and then they will choose the corresponding number pairs based on memory. After they pass the memory game one time, they can see all the images in the database. If they don't want to play the game, they can enter the access code "BIOSTAT821" to skip the game.

### Architecture

This web uses a vanilla JavaScript/HTML user interface, Python game engines, and SQLite database.
